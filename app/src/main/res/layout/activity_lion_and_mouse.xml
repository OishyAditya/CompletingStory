            android:text="Once a lion was sleeping in a forest. Suddenly a mouse came there.
It did not notice the sleeping lion. It was running about and playing happily.
By change it ran over the face of the lion. It awoke the lion.
At this the lion grew very angry with the silly mouse. The mouse became very much frightened.
But he did not lose heart. He said to the lion, ' O king of the jungle, I am very tiny creature.
 I made a great mistake, Please forgive me this time. I may be of some help to you any time.
Hearing this lion smiled and let the mouse go. Days, months and years passed by . One night mouse heard the roar of a lion.
The mouse went to the place from where the sound was coming. Having reached there he saw the lion trapped in a hunterâ€™s net.
The net was too strong for the lion to tear. The mouse gave his identity and requested him not to make sound.
Then the mouse began to cut the rope with its sharp teeth. The lion was freed before dawn.
The lion expressed his gratitude to the mouse. The mouse said in reply, 'Even the smallest creatures can be of great help to the giants.'"
